This is an extension to the current Jute/Hadoop record IO package that generates serialization/de-serialization code from DDL to support RCFile format.  In order to use this package, you want to the following:

1) generate JuteRC.jar
% mvn install

2) run rcc against DDL file 
./rcc --language javarc src/test/ddl/mydatatype.jr

in the above example, my DDL is named mydatatype.jr.  You can give your own DDL file.

Now your java serialization/de-serialization code are ready. It should be located under com/yahoo/ccdi/fetl. Copy them to the targeted directory and start using them.  Don't forget to put JuteRc.jar on your CLASSPATH when compile.

Look into the unit test case, TestRc.java as an example of how to use it in detail.  This package is tested using ELTKey.jr and ETLValue.jr in MapReduce job.  

Note:
Java code under juterc.compiler.generated is generated by JavaCC via running
% ${JAVACC_HOME}/bin/javacc juterc/compiler/generated/rcc.jj
This is one time thing. I can, however, make this code generation a build target of maven.
